Some Quantum Computing Codes, written in Python 3 using the IBM module Qiskit
Most of the experiments are performed on a simulator, which simulates the quantum conditions
and gives the accurate result. However, some experiments have also been performed on a real Quantum Computer
based in IBM. Personally, I don't prefer using it, however awesome it is because the results from a real Quantum
Computer has errors and I'm just beginning to learn Error Mitigation

Some codes here demonstrate the strange properties of Quantum Mechanics and the potential
of Quantum Computing. A very Good Example is the code I wrote for Quantum Teleportation, which
Teleports the information of one qubit to another. This is important because in QM, we cannot just
Copy information because of the No Cloning Theorem.

My favorite Code, however is the one titled "Combinations1". It takes some lists(sequences of data) and a Quantum Circuit chooses
a combination between them, totally randomly. This is amazing to me because in normal computation, we would mostly use an in-built
function like rand(), which is only a very good approximation of randomness, however, QM is inherently Random and probabilistic, therefore this
Combination is truly Random.
